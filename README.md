# Smart-Plant-Monitoring-Device

#The Internet of Things (IoT) allows objects to be identified and controlled from a distance using existing network infrastructure, opening up new possibilities. greater efficiency, accuracy, and financial benefit through more direct contact between the actual and virtual worlds and computer-based systems.In order to maximise water consumption and maintain a green environment, it is important to irrigate more effectively as water supplies become increasingly scarce and polluted. The goal of this project is to create a smart houseplant watering and monitoring system that analyses and records environmental factors to help plants thrive. The sensors collect and evaluate data regarding changing weather and soil moisture levels before sending timely warnings to the userâ€™s Android phone.
